As you address things, update lastBranchNotes.text





Current issue: display Spot detail.
Reviews not set. Why?
What sets reviews: only allreviews by spot/user. So for spot details, spot. But, also need them for user IF spot has more than 0, so can easily determine if a given spot has already had a review by this user. So, MAY need both run. How can we tell if we need it?
    If state.spots[spot.id]?.numReviews undefined/null (0 ok) then haven't read spot reviews start that.
    If state.session.user?.reviews is undefined then haven't looked for user reviews.


Ensure app runs in dev mode with new store and Spot, Review and SpotImage changes with new migrations/seeds.

Then focus on MVP issues.

APPLICATION
NOT UP TO Wireframe
  Landing page --The css does not fully match what's expected from the wireframes. An example is the gap between each spot.
  Spot Details --Css does not match the wireframes https://jeffbnb.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Grading/Jun23/William/Shauck_William_callout_box_on_the_left.png
  View Rating and Reviews --1 reviews is shown https://jeffbnb.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Grading/Jun23/William/Shauck_William_reviews_is_shown_instead_of_review.png
  Post Review --Css does not match the wireframes.
  Manage Spots --Css does not fully match the wireframes.
  Delete a Review --Css does not match the wireframes.
The callout information box on the right of the spot's detail page should state the price for the spot followed by the label "night", and have a "Reserve" button.
  Callout box is not located on the right side
If no reviews have been posted yet and the current user is logged-in and is NOT the owner of the spot, replace the reviews list with the text "Be the first to post a review!"
  _not_be_the_first_to_post_a_review_text.png
If the current user is logged-in and they are viewing a spot's detail page for a spot that they HAVE NOT posted a review yet, a "Post Your Review" button shows between the rating/reviews heading and the list of reviews.
  In new spots this button does not show.
The spot management page should contain a spot tile list similar to the one in the landing page (thumbnail image, location, rating, price).
  Rating on the manage page does not match what is actually on the db.
When the update form submission is successful, the user is navigated to the updated spot's details page.
  Update does not seem to work.
The updated spot's detail page should display the updated information. No refresh should be necessary.
