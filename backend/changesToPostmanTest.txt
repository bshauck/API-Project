Here's the list of changes made for Lillith's Postman test script to work

Errors in API I corrected
    2 500s should be 400s
    1 500 should be 403
    Several (4?) 200s should be 201s (that create new table rows)
    It IS OK for a startDate and different booking endDate to be the same.
    People leave in the morning and come in the evening. (Similarly for
    endDates)
    Allow owner to make booking of own spot (implementation of unavailable)
change all review things to look for commentary instead of review

Errors in script:
  line 12 of POST Signup needs ()s after keyword function



Investigate if you can run something before test script run

if cascade delete is set appropriately, only this one delete
command needs to run to clean up after a rest:
DELETE FROM Users WHERE lastName='AATester';
Ensure no cookies, or perhaps run option don't use cookies

    POST Create an Image for a Spot

    GET Details of a Spot by Id - Verify Creation, Image updatedAt
Got NaN


    POST Error - Log In - Invalid credentials
 "The provided credentials [were] invalid" ==> "The provided credentials [are] invalid"
    POST Create an Image for a Spot (extended to allow multiple in one request)
So return value is an array of spot images, not just a single spot
[
    {
        "id": 187,
        "url": "image.jpg",
    }
]

    GET Get Details of a Spot by Id - Verify Creation, Image updatedAt
expected NaN not to be NaN

    POST Not AUTHED - Create an Image for a Spot
Wanted error message to be "Spot doesn't belong to you"
Wanted title to be Forbidden (optional)
{
    "message": "Forbidden",
    "stack": "Error: Forbidden\n    at unauthor (/home/shauck/aa-projects/project/HeirErrBnb/backend/utils/auth.js:95:11)\n    at fitsAuthor (/home/shauck/aa-projects/project/HeirErrBnb/backend/utils/auth.js:107:5)\n    at /home/shauck/aa-projects/project/HeirErrBnb/backend/routes/api/spots.js:97:9"
}


    PUT NOT AUTHED - Edit a Spot
    DELETE NOT AUTHED - Delete a Spot
    DELETE NOT AUTHED - Delete a Spot (given null for spotId)
same issues as last, but also got a 404 "instead" of a 403
    POST Create an Image for a Review - 1,2,3,4 through 11
all gave back 500 instead of 200 but passed id did not correspond
    to a reviewId; 166 instead of 158 was the highest; but why not
    404 instead of 500

GET Get Reviews of Current User - Verify Creation, Prevention, Image updated
GET Get Reviews of Current Spot
    Manually check is reason for error

POST ERROR - Create a Booking - Same Start and End Date (I disagree with test)
    Did give error, but text was not just "Bad Request" started with
    "End date must be la"
POST ERROR - Create a Booking - end date earlier than startDate
    Wanted only "Bad Request"
POST ERROR - Create a Booking - Start on existing Ending date
I disagree this is an error, and it succeeded with 201
POST ERROR - Create a Booking - End date on existing startDate
I disagree this is an error, and it succeeeded with 201
POST ERROR - Create a Booking - dates encompass other booking
Error text different

GET CURRENT USER Bookings
returns 200, but has problem, but says test manually, test script could be off
PUT Edit a Booking
    Wanted 200, but got 403, I'm guessing difference in approach for
    when a booking may be edited. I said no if startDate has happened

PUT Edit a Booking checking if ignore yourself when surrounding
    I fail; may not have handled this case correctly

PUT ERROR Edit a Booking - Same Start / End
PUT ERROR Edit a Booking - End before Start
    Error text wanted was Bad Request

PUT ERROR Edit a Booking - surrounding
    manually check
GET Get all Current User's Bookings; manually verify validateEditSpot
GET Get all Bookings for a Spot by Id - manually verify

POST NOT AUTHED -Create an Image for a Review
    may be related to returning multiple imagers, not sure
POST Booking another reconsideration; I believe I will implement
    Owner marking Spots unavailable for booking, whatever the
    front end looks like, simply by making a booking for their
    own spot, so I disagree with the API here too.

POST NOT AUTHED Edit a Review that isn't yourself
PUT NOT AUTHED Edit  Booking that isn't yours
DELETE NOT AUTHED Try to delete a review /image /booking that isn't yours
    Disagree about error text

DELETE doesn't correctly check for Review Image not existing with null
    returns 404, but body says Successfully
    ABOVE POINTS OUT have common 404 return case

DELETE Review
    disagree about success text
DELETE Booking with invalid id
    Optional title not set

DELETE Spot-Image/null expects 200, doesn't like 404
    Thinks message should say successfully deleted; DISAGREE
DELETE Spot-Image/null invalid id (but has same subject as above)
    Says Request resource instead of Spot Image couldn't be found

Want attempts to delete/edit booking/review/review-image with 403 to says blah doesn't belong to you
(although review-image incorrectly tests for review)
I do have code to attempt to check for PUT Booking its own id as not
part of the possible conflicting dates; but possibly I need to manually
check it is working

  Looks like test for GET All current user bookings checks for
something wrong
  Looks like the POST req body for ReviewImage didn't include a reviewId.

  the string for urls could be improved (for front-end, they will
actually restrict you, unnecesarily, to .jpg, .jpeg, and .png)
