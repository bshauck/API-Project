commit fe2988f35e0defe1ea51a5fce12d522ff3fd0252
above is Mod4 API passing version

branch: fixDBErrorCodes
current feature: fix 2 db table constraint violations
wrongly put in Mod 4 API as 500s and changed to 400s.
fix an attempt to put in a review when the user
already has a review for that spot from status
code 500 to 403.
Change 4 row creations given status code of 200 to
201.
Change image creation interfaces to take either a
single url, or to take an array of URLs. If array
given, then if Spot images, the first is the preview
image; and the rest are additional images.
Current frontend API will
not allow creation of more than 5 spot images anyway.
Updated backend API documentation to reflect all
of these changes.
