Some differences Dan has agreed to:
    Prices are whole integers
    Avg Ratings are shown in fixed pt 1 if
        2nd decimal is 0; else fixed pt 2
    "Extra" create spot button on Manage Spots
        page doesn't have to disappear/disable
    Score card 19 doesn't make sense; 15 applies
        (no "average" for 0 review spots, just "New")


=== BEGIN BUGS =====

Sign up button doesn't handle valid email validation
    (no email is sent out; assumption is @ present makes it valid)

Single Spot page seems to break on unsuccessful sign up
    Spot Details page doesn't break now

Avg rating on home/details page doesn't match manage spots
    All review numbers/ratings are consistent

Unable to create review on new spot
    Can create reviews on new spots

Unable to update spot
    Can update a spot

Going from Manage Spot to Home page sometimes has bug
    No bugs going to home page

When looking at a site with no reviews; number of requests goes up with no stop
    Unsure what "requests" are, but no strangeness occurs now when looking a spots without reviews

===== END BUGS =====

==== BEGIN SCORE CARD ITEMS (CSS at END)===

---AUTHENTICATION----
When clicking "Sign up" button on the new user account form with errors in the form, it must show all error messages returned from the backend (similar to the following): "The provided email is invalid" or "Username must be unique".

The only errors you can see from the backend are
    Please provide a valid email
    Email must be unique
    Username must be unique
    Username cannot be an email

There are many others, but they are all hidden by frontend checks
The only way to see 2 from the backend simultaneously is
    Please provide a valid email
    Username cannot be an email

These are two different validation fields. You cannot get a
validation error PLUS a db error, because no db access is made
if validation fails. You cannot get TWO db errors, because the
db only sends one back at a time.
    to generate first, avoid @ in email;
    to generate 2nd, put @ in username
So, example of email is invalid plus unique username could
never happen, as that combines validation with db error.
