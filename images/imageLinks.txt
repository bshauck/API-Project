ISSUES

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400)

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON

Interface correct for insertion of images with create spot (Postman good)

StarRating

header spacing: added bottom to allow ManageSpots to work: modal apparently
    NOT on top of other elements

More:
Reviews added to Spot details
Create Review
Delete Review

FINALLY CSS



image pics, server vs local copies, changing specified
Making default to show no image present
Generate large amount of data




Bonus:
review update
Bookings
map API
store shape efficiency
caching
validate images





Achieved:
Chose a different icon / favicon, and set images
Deleted old tries and commented code
Did some debugging of Sequelize issue with bulkCreate of Image table rows
Finalized StarRating component
Small amout of CSS for nav bar elements
