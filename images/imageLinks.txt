FRIDAY
Changed pictures to those hosted by Flickr for faster load
In CreateSpot thunk, ensure that singleSpot version of id was
retrieved to have Owner data, before sending Create to db. Actually,
Update can only be done by owner, so current user has the info needed;
but anyone can see details so we do need to start ensureing user data
retrieved and store; will start using newer store outline for this.
After create spot; now owner's name showing correctly

SATURDAY
removed null bug introduced in Friday changes to session reducer
started changes to seeders based on getting more requirements method
  30 char in spot description
  preview always state
  some supporting images
  all reviews have an image
  every spot has 5-10 reviews by appropriate non-owners with
     random text and rating
  update previewUrl in singleSpot in reducer (should change DB)
  moved login db errors under heading
  getting newly created spot id after create spot
    to correctly go to the spot details page
  fixed update bug
  CreateSpot lists support images vertically
  EditSpot ignores all images
  SpotForm  ANd PUT
    error messages in them correctly for create.


ISSUES
Browser refresh doesn't update Manage Spots
Reviews add to SpotDetails
Callout box add to SpotDetails
Adding Callout with price night, small review avg, Reserve button
StarRatings add to SpotDetails' callout box
CreateReview
DeleteReview
Review List of Review Tiles (in update order; new added to beginning)
    Review Tile has
    Star Rating string
    Post Your Review optional button
    If No Reviews, then optional Be the first to post a review! string
    FirstName of reviewer
    Optional Delete button (if your review)
Post Your Review opens modal dialog for inputting Review
Need open star icon for review rating with Paw Print functionality
Delete button opens modal dialog for deleting Review
On delete, review counts and averages need to be updated

Subheading size too large
Subheading weight too heavy
Regular text too large
Heading weight somewhat more
Textarea needs to extend across
L/R edges of most elements need to align
Submit button needs to be centered and colored
Remove DEFAULT button (LAST THING)
Comma misplaced on Create Spot (city, state)
Confirm spot image creation working NO
Have reasonable image sizing (tiles should be 3x6)
CSS Delete Spot modal
CSS not-logged-in menu
CSS sign up dialog form

Adding Fake descriptive text for host
Adding divider on Spot details

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400) (decoration
suggested removing the csrfFetch throw, just checking the error code, using
async/await; changed login modal handling but need to do that for signup;
long term do better with then.catch consistency)

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON


header spacing: added bottom to allow ManageSpots to work: modal apparently
    NOT on top of other elements

More:

FINALLY CSS
Form placeholder text lighter
price "night", star rating "review" both darker



Making default to show no image present
Generate large amount of data
Have SpotForm show first 4 validation error messages to side of label

BUGS:
Login on error (invalid password/credential) changes size,
and a sliver of a modalDIv appears underneath main modal
Should seed a SpotImage for preview for every seeded Spot
(should do a lot for generated photo data, but have a
placeholder URI now--see frontend utils)


Bonus:
review update
Bookings
map API
after map API add read-only lat/long to SpotForm
store shape efficiency
caching
validate images
query search to change what spots are listed

Achieved:


Longterm:
Have previewUrl stored in Spot
Remove preview from Spot Images table
SpotImages are only support images;
Update Spot has to do more work if
  updating existing images to different opens
  the previewUrl just stored in Spot,
  but the supporting ones being changed means
  have to look at differences and figure
  out what are insertions, and what are updates
  into the SpotImages table.
Dan says 100-1000 generated seeds
Look up all unseed functions via known userSpots
