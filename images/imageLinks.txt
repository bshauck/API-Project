FRIDAY
Changed pictures to those hosted by Flickr for faster load
In CreateSpot thunk, ensure that singleSpot version of id was
retrieved to have Owner data, before sending Create to db. Actually,
Update can only be done by owner, so current user has the info needed;
but anyone can see details so we do need to start ensureing user data
retrieved and store; will start using newer store outline for this.
After create spot; now owner's name showing correctly

Subheading size too large

CSS Delete Spot modal

Adding Fake descriptive text for host
Adding divider on Spot details

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400) (decoration
suggested removing the csrfFetch throw, just checking the error code, using
async/await; changed login modal handling but need to do that for signup;
long term do better with then.catch consistency)

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON


More:

FINALLY CSS
Form placeholder text lighter
price "night", star rating "review" both darker



Generate large amount of data
Have SpotForm show first 4 validation error messages to side of label

BUGS:
Login on error (invalid password/credential) changes size,
and a sliver of a modalDIv appears underneath main modal




Bonus:
review update
Bookings
map API
after map API add read-only lat/long to SpotForm
store shape efficiency
caching
validate images
query search to change what spots are listed

Achieved:


Longterm:
Have previewUrl stored in Spot
Remove preview from Spot Images table
SpotImages are only support images;
Update Spot has to do more work if
  updating existing images to different opens
  the previewUrl just stored in Spot,
  but the supporting ones being changed means
  have to look at differences and figure
  out what are insertions, and what are updates
  into the SpotImages table.
Dan says 100-1000 generated seeds
Look up all unseed functions via known userSpots
Restore query size default to 20 (set to 50 for
  dev atm)
