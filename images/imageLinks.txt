CSS progress:
swapped order of signup/login
 made create a new spot button and manage
    spots button look like text
 added divider below manage spots button
 added opacity to menu
 positioned absolutely
 changed z-index
 removed bullets
 logout button navigates to /
 styled logout button and positioned
 login form adjusted towards wireframe
 demo user button added

ISSUES

Spots for user should be listed in updateDate order
(new added to beginning)

Confirm spot image creation working NO
Delete Spot does not cause update on ManageSpots previewImage
Successful new Spot creation takes to SpotDetails
Have reasonable image sizing (tiles should be 5 across, 4 high or 4x5)
UserMenu has inappropriate items on it
Reviews add to SpotDetails
Callout box add to SpotDetails
StarRatings add to SpotDetails
CreateReview
DeleteReview
Delete Spot CSS
CSS not-logged-in menu
CSS sign up dialog form

Adding Fake descriptive text for host
Adding Callout with price night, small review avg, Reserve button
Adding divider on Spot details
List of Review Tiles (in update order; new added to beginning)
    Review Tile has
    Star Rating string
    Post Your Review optional button
    If No Reviews, then optional Be the first to post a review! string
    FirstName of reviewer
    Optional Delete button (if your review)
Post Your Review opens modal dialog for inputting Review
Need open star icon for review rating with Paw Print functionality
Delete button opens modal dialog for deleting Review
On delete, review counts and averages need to be updated

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400)

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON


header spacing: added bottom to allow ManageSpots to work: modal apparently
    NOT on top of other elements

More:
Create Review
Delete Review

FINALLY CSS
Form placeholder text lighter
price "night", star rating "review" both darker



image pics, server vs local copies, changing specified
Making default to show no image present
Generate large amount of data
Have SpotForm show first 4 validation error messages to side of label



Bonus:
review update
Bookings
map API
after map API add read-only lat/long to SpotForm
store shape efficiency
caching
validate images
query search to change what spots are listed

Achieved:
DeleteSpot correctly removes menu in all cases
Interface correct for insertion of images with create spot (Postman good)
