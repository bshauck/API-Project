Thursday progress:
found placeholder site for URI
use placeholder to at least preview image in for
missing SpotImages (should be fixed in seeder data)
fixed bug with showing db errors on login after
changing to "pure" async / await.
Fixed bugs in multiple places having to do with bad
initial approach to .then.catch (which I believe eventually
is the better way to go, but not for this evaluation)
Changed reducer methods to be more consistent with producing
new refs
Worked around bug in autologin for demo user


ISSUES
SpotForm needs to list urls vertically,
  and ignore them for Update. ANd PUT
  error messages in them correctly.
back to some issue with creating a spot
getting newly created spot id after create spot
  to correctly go to the spot details page
Update correctly for Delete Spot for user
Spots for user should be listed in updateDate order
(new added to beginning)
Browser refresh doesn't update Manage Spots

Confirm spot image creation working NO
Delete Spot does not cause update on ManageSpots previewImage
Successful new Spot creation takes to SpotDetails
Have reasonable image sizing (tiles should be 5 across, 4 high or 4x5)
Reviews add to SpotDetails
Callout box add to SpotDetails
StarRatings add to SpotDetails
CreateReview
DeleteReview
CSS Delete Spot modal
CSS not-logged-in menu
CSS sign up dialog form


Adding Fake descriptive text for host
Adding Callout with price night, small review avg, Reserve button
Adding divider on Spot details
List of Review Tiles (in update order; new added to beginning)
    Review Tile has
    Star Rating string
    Post Your Review optional button
    If No Reviews, then optional Be the first to post a review! string
    FirstName of reviewer
    Optional Delete button (if your review)
Post Your Review opens modal dialog for inputting Review
Need open star icon for review rating with Paw Print functionality
Delete button opens modal dialog for deleting Review
On delete, review counts and averages need to be updated

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400)

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON


header spacing: added bottom to allow ManageSpots to work: modal apparently
    NOT on top of other elements

More:
Create Review
Delete Review

FINALLY CSS
Form placeholder text lighter
price "night", star rating "review" both darker



image pics, server vs local copies, changing specified
Making default to show no image present
Generate large amount of data
Have SpotForm show first 4 validation error messages to side of label

BUGS:
Login on error (invalid password/credential) changes size,
and a sliver of a modalDIv appears underneath main modal
Should seed a SpotImage for preview for every seeded Spot
(should do a lot for generated photo data, but have a
placeholder URI now--see frontend utils)


Bonus:
review update
Bookings
map API
after map API add read-only lat/long to SpotForm
store shape efficiency
caching
validate images
query search to change what spots are listed

Achieved:
DeleteSpot correctly removes menu in all cases
Interface correct for insertion of images with create spot (Postman good)
