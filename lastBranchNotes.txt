better spacing for signup/login
more console.logs to remove

remove redundant user session settings (just depend on user object setting: reviews, spots, bookings)
review slice correctly updated with delete/create; however:

deleting spot should cascade in store and delete all associated
reviews, bookings, spotImages,
deleting review should cascade in store and delete all review images
