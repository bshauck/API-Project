MONDAY
Login modal again autocloses after successful login
Spot create form no longer insists on extra images
Placeholders used in spotdetails if not enough images

remove redundant user session settings (just depend on
user object setting: reviews, spots, bookings)
test and check all interdependency reducers are correct

check every App start page for doing browser refresh and handling no current state information


review slice correctly updated with delete/create; however:
spot not updated with create (but was with delete)
session.reviews still has deleted review key; does NOT have created review key
lack of create for both possibly because of error
read spot reviews didn't corrrectly update spotLatest

deleting spot should cascade in store and delete all associated
reviews, bookings, spotImages,
deleting review should cascade in store and delete all review images

Check out create and edit spots; after getting Manage Spots
