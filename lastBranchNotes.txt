WEDNESDAY
Similar page layout for all main pages (ManageSpots, SpotList,
SpotDetails)
header line goes ALL the way across
changed css approach for closer wireframe emulation
handle spot details click on entire tile, wtihout interfering
  with Manage Spots update/delete buttons (before just img)


better spacing for signup/login
more console.logs to remove
drop shadow for login on modal
change color for disabled login to white back black fore, then
  to red back, white fore when active
  (probably true for all red buttons is disabled)
  drop shadow also changes to grey from black
color seems bluish for many text items
better line up on Spot Details page
better spacing on create form



colors for default Airbnb page
(247,247,247) main background
border color (221,221,221)
input color rgb(84, 84, 84)

test and check all interdependency reducers are correct

check every App start page for doing browser refresh and handling no current state information

remove redundant user session settings (just depend on user object setting: reviews, spots, bookings)
review slice correctly updated with delete/create; however:

deleting spot should cascade in store and delete all associated
reviews, bookings, spotImages,
deleting review should cascade in store and delete all review images
(DB handles auto)
