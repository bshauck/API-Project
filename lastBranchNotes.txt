There is just one #modal

    right: 0;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  #modal-background {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  }

  #modal-content {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: white;
  }



test and check all interdependency reducers are correct

spot not updated with create (but was with delete)
session.reviews still has deleted review key; does NOT have created review key
read spot reviews didn't corrrectly update spotLatest
check every App start page for doing browser refresh and handling no current state information

remove redundant user session settings (just depend on user object setting: reviews, spots, bookings)
review slice correctly updated with delete/create; however:

deleting spot should cascade in store and delete all associated
reviews, bookings, spotImages,
deleting review should cascade in store and delete all review images
(DB handles auto)

Check out create and edit spots; after getting Manage Spots
