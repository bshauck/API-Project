Last branch notes

WEDNESDAY
Continue work on react-calendar
Pause react-calendar as Prime Calendar seems better
  Dan agrees that is an ok package to use
Some additional CSS for calendar and for CreateBookings page
Create Booking working and tied to Request to Book button

THURSDAY
Fixed missed issues with bookings from Mod 4 backend.
Issue with launching calendar on separate inline page
  seems to log out current user
Fixed rereading bookings for user every time
    ManageBookings launched
Modalize calendar
Launch calendar with range selected
Update create/update booking page from calendar

Issue with generated bookings overlapping; for now, only future bookings with increasing dates.






Better coloring for range; more visible; Black circle white text
  for start / ends
Need to CSS empty ManageBookings page, filled page,
   and calendar
Launch calendar with pre-disabled dates of other
    future bookings
On first click (potentialStartDate) disable all dates prior
Disable (hide) prev/next buttons for paging through
   calendar whenever minDate/maxDate is showing
And hover highlighting when moving across dates
Rename Calendar2 back to Calendar

p-datepicker-prev (button for moving left; visibility: hidden when seeing minDate; same for -next and maxDate; set visible when moving away)
add all dates earlier than first click as disabled; remove when endDate clicked (avoids the backwards range picking)
onSelectDate(date) {
  // deselect the date
  this.calendar.deselectDate(date);
}
     setStartDate();
     setStartDate(new Date());
(may have to set date to undefined/null to cause an rerender on programmatic date change)


Need to make modal Calendar to set Booking date range
Connect Update to version of calendar
Need to CSS everything
Perhaps colorize Booking dates which conflict with others. (we allow creating conflicting reservations; as we don't know which may be cancelled; users will be liable for fees at a certain point)
Need to redo checks; not correctly ignoring id of updated booking with date checks
Still need to DRY duplicated bookingOk check code


Sat/Sun/Mon have 3-night min?
MAP API
First, create vetting and error reporting on Create/Update Spot form;
fill in long lat for vetted addresses.
Add read-only fields for long/lat display.

Put floating map button on landing page, and show map



FOR profile dropdown:
  relative parent
    absolute with coords for dropdown menu


better spacing for signup/login
more console.logs to remove
drop shadow for login on modal

change color/border on hover for various things
color seems bluish for many text items
better line up on Spot Details page
better spacing on create form
create logging table for login's and attempts


go through divs and add background as necessary
 change other tags to class and use background-color
  when you can instead of background


colors for default Airbnb page
(247,247,247) main background
border color (221,221,221)
input color rgb(84, 84, 84)

test and check all interdependency reducers are correct

check every App start page for doing browser refresh and handling no current state information

remove redundant user session settings (just depend on user object setting: reviews, spots, bookings)
review slice correctly updated with delete/create; however:

deleting spot should cascade in store and delete all associated
reviews, bookings, spotImages,
deleting review should cascade in store and delete all review images
(DB handles auto)
