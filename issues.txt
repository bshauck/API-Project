Change default page size back to 20 (from 50), and track how you do
  listing of landing spots, and maintain that, and know page being
  displayed through renders

Understanding entire flow of error-handling and implementing correctly
from front request with thunk to thunk fetch (I understand backend, and
csrfFetch checking status code and throwing error when code >= 400) (decoration
suggested removing the csrfFetch throw, just checking the error code, using
async/await; changed login modal handling but need to do that for signup;
long term do better with then.catch consistency)
If we do throws from thunk then all app code has to have catch and handle throws;
instead we do returns from thunk and only check for thing.errors.

Better understanding of Promise .then.catch
Knowing when things may be promises; and why some things that are
    Promises are sometimes, are also not sometimes
    e.g., response from fetch does not always understand .JSON


FINALLY CSS
Form placeholder text lighter
price "night", star rating "review" both darker
Generate better, larger amount of data

BUGS:
Login on error (invalid password/credential) changes size,
and a sliver of a modalDiv appears underneath main modal
